## Zlib

-------
### Perl script (zlib.pl) to inflate and deflate AppleHDA resource files in Mountain Lion DP3 and greater.


All the credit goes to its original author [RevoGirl](mailto:DutchHockeyGoalie@yahoo.com), I only added the ability to process multiple files at one drag.

It was painful when you just want to deflate multiple files.
